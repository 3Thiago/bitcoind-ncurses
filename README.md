# bitcoind-ncurses

ncurses front-end for bitcoind
produced by Amphibian (azeteki, atelopus_zeteki)

## dependencies
python 2.something
jgarzik's bitcoinrpc library (https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc)

## usage
pretty bare bones for now.
rename example.conf to bitcoind-ncurses.conf and enter your details.
the program will die hard if the config file is incorrect or it fails to connect.
this will be improved in a later release.
 
## launch
$ python bitcoind-ncurses.py

## hotkeys
t: enter transaction view mode
b: enter block view mode
d: enter default / stat tracking mode
up/down arrows: scroll within view modes
g: enter a txid for viewing
q: quit bitcoind-ncurses

found bitcoind-ncurses useful?
donations are your way of showing that!

my main machine is currently a 6 year old Atom laptop.
upgrading that would be rather useful.
cheers!
